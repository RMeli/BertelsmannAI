# Bertelsmann Technology Scholarship - AI Track

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the AI track of the [Udacity-Bertelsmann Technology Scholarhip](https://www.udacity.com/bertelsmann-tech-scholarships) and follows the course structure.

Most of the notebooks are based on the ones in the official [Deep Learning (PyTorch)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch) [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) repository, but they are often heavily modified with the incorporation of personal notes, comments and additional concepts.
